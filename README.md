🍽️ Zometo-Analysis

A data-analysis project built to explore and derive insights from the “Zometo / Zomato” restaurant dataset. The goal is to clean, visualize, and analyze the data to understand restaurant trends: costs, ratings, cuisines, customer behavior, and more.

🎯 Project Objective

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of restaurants (names, cost for two, ratings, votes, online order availability, cuisine/type, etc.)
Clean & preprocess the raw dataset for accurate analysis
Visualize data distributions: cost, ratings, votes, restaurant type, etc.
Derive insights about restaurant cost-range, popularity, rating trends, service types (e.g. online order, dine-in), and more
Provide actionable understanding that might help restaurateurs, food-delivery analysts, or anyone interested in the food-service domain

🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

Python — for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
Pandas, NumPy — data processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn (or other plotting libraries) — for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook — interactive analysis and exploration
CSV / Flat-file datasets — as source data

If you used any additional libraries (e.g. Plotly, PowerBI export, etc.), you can list them here too.

🚀 How to Run / Use

1.  Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/khushang-2326/Zometo-Analysis
    cd Zometo-Analysis


2.  Install dependencies
    Use pip (or conda) to install required Python libraries, for example:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

   (Adjust based on actual libraries used.)

3.  Run the analysis
    Open zometo_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to reproduce analysis and visuals.
    Or run zometo_project.py (if available) to execute scripted analysis.

4.  Explore results — charts, graphs and findings will help you understand patterns in restaurant data: pricing, ratings, services, etc.

🔎 What This Project Covers

Data cleaning: handling missing/invalid values, parsing columns correctly
Feature extraction / transformation (if needed)
Statistical summaries & descriptive metrics (mean, median, counts, distributions)
Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, heatmaps (as per your analysis)
Insights regarding
Typical cost-for-two distribution
Rating vs cost vs votes analysis
Popular cuisine types / restaurant types
Service types (online ordering vs dine-in / table booking) and their impact on ratings / popularity

💡 Potential Use Cases

For food-delivery platforms or restaurant owners: Understand what cost-range or service types customers prefer.
For data-analytics learners / students: Use as a template for dataset analysis projects.
For anyone interested in food industry analytics: Explore how ratings, pricing, and services are correlated.
